That's it, you've finished the simulation! Hope you've enjoyed the exercise.

Note: There is another session which covers ([mapping the computation onto GPUs](Session 3 Part 1.ipynb)). However, this machine is not equipped with GPUs, so you won't be able to follow the instructions and see it run. Feel free to take a look at play around with it, if you're still interested.
