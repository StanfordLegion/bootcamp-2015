# Session 3 Part 2

In the previous part, you might have seen some (but small) performance differences between different mapping decisions. Those differences of course will become more pronounced once the problem size you run your program gets bigger. The goal of this exercise is to explore different mapping choices and figure out which mappings perform the best and why.

We are giving you in this part a bit bigger problem of 100K nodes and 400K wires in 40 pieces. Also, we are giving you mapping rules that map the three simulation tasks to CPUs and map their regions to the system memory. Your task is,

- Find the best combination of mappings of tasks you can find.

The syntax guide from the preivous part will be useful, so we give it below as well.
